 As a computer scientist with expertise in artificial intelligence, data analytics, I have a strong foundation in statistical methods, machine learning and data analytics. 
 I am skilled in conducting rigorous research to uncover insights and drive decision-making. My expertise lies in using data to answer complex questions and develop new theories.
 I have a proven track record in teaching and success in publishing research findings in academic journals and presenting at conferences along with
 securing research funds. I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, machine learning tools, and have experience working with large, complex datasets. I also have experience in teaching
 at undergraduate level. I am looking for a challenging and dynamic role in academia where I can utilize my skills and continue to grow.

          The objective is to develop a data-driven approach to predict student outcome
          (fail/pass) in online learning. In addition, this proposal aims at investigating factors that affect
          student satisfaction given the particularity of the learning setting. The addressed challenges
          are of paramount importance for an educational-minded country like Qatar. Indeed, since the
          outbreak of COVID-19, Qatar University and several other educational institutions in Qatar
          have opted for online learning to ensure the continuation of the education process. Hence,
          the research questions this research proposal raises, add significant value to the educational
          system that Qatar aims at equipping the citizens with to achieve their aspirations and to meet
          the needs of Qatarâ€™s society.
