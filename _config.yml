        title: Speculating Student Performance and Satisfaction in Online Learning During a Pandemic
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The goal is to devise a data-driven method to predict student outcomes (fail/pass) in online learning and explore factors influencing student satisfaction in this context. 
          Given Qatar's emphasis on education and the shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic by institutions like Qatar University, this research is crucial. 
          It addresses vital questions, enhancing Qatar's educational system to fulfill societal needs and student aspirations.
